      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Begin by par-boiling the soaked rice - it should be firm but not
          entirely raw. Drain and set aside
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Place a heavy-based saucepan over a medium-low heat and add the oil
          and ghee. When hot, add all the whole spices and cook for 30 seconds,
          or until you can smell the oil being aromatized by the spices
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Increase to a medium heat, add the red onions and fry until light
          golden. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until the
          garlic no longer smells raw
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the tomatoes and cook until the moisture has evaporated (add about
          1-2 tbsp for water if the tomatoes start to burn). The result should
          be a thick, rich sauce with no hard tomato bits, and the oil should
          rise to the surface of the sauce. Add the turmeric and red chilli
          powder
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the beef and stir-fry until sealed, for about 2-3 minutes. Add the
          Greek yoghurt and continue to stir-fry until the moisture of the
          yoghurt evaporates and you are left with a sauce consistency. Cover
          the pan and turn the heat to low
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Allow to cook until the sauce is thick and reddish-brown, and the oil
          rises to the top; this will take around 15-20 minutes of cooking.
          After this time if the meat isn’t cook through, you may need to add a
          little water and cook covered for a few more minutes until the sauce
          is thick again
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Once the meat is cooked through, layer the rice evenly on top of the
          meat. Poke the lemon, mint and green chilli into the rice, pour over
          the saffron and rose water or kewra and then using a piece of foil,
          cover the entire surface of the saucepan and place the lid firmly over
          to create a seal, so the steam does not escape the pan
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Turn the heat to it’s lowest setting and steam cook for 10 minutes.
          Once done, remove the foil and let the steam escape
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Mix the rice, meat and sauce gently using a dessert spoon so as to not
          break the rice. Serve hot in a serving dish and scatter over the
          pistachios and rose petals or buds
        </li>
      </ol>
