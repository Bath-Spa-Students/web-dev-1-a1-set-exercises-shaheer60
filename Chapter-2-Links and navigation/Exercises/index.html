          story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a
          great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most
          dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family
          and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the
          planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a

        <h4>Dune, must see in Imax</h4>
        <p>
          Dune 2021 is a cinimatic masterpiece. The art, the music, the
          characters, the story. Everything lets you get immersed in this story.
          This is what we have been waiting for since the matrix back in 1999.
        </p>

        <h4>New favorite movie!!</h4>
        <p>
          I just watched it and I am so amazed right now. I loved basically
          everything about it. Unlike Marvel or the new Star Wars movies there
          were no silly jokes, which break an epic moment. Dune is an adult and
          absolutely epic movie. Just incredible.
        </p>

        <h4>Scenic, fantastic, edge gripping</h4>
        <p>
          I was expecting a lot to be honest, but it has delivered beyond that.
          Scenic and fantastic worlds are build without CGI being the first
          thought that comes to mind. The space part of the narrative is not
          something that fills up the time. The music is maybe the most
          surprising part, it is really really good.<br />
          <br />
          Without trailing off in details of script or story telling, it really
          isn't a story that builds to a single climax or fix point, it just
          delivers edge gripping narrative for 150 minutes. I need to upgrade my
          Hi-fi for when it becomes available and I am looking really forward to
          part two!
        </p>

        <h4>Epic in every sense</h4>
        <p>
          Dune is an instant classic; IMO the greatest sci-fi movie of this
          century, among the best movies of all time. It does pretty much
          everything right. It's close to flawless. The visuals will leave you
          breathless. They are overwhelming in their scope, detail and vivid
          clarity and I'm not talking about pixel resolution. Dennis simply sees
          the unimaginable, fictional worlds in distant future with vivid,
          intricate, multilayered clarity. It's a rare, super special gift he
          possesses. <br />
          <br />
          All of the characters carry mystery, depth, sensibilities, strengths
          and insecurities and they feel incredibly relatable.You feel them,
          even in their most surreal circumstances. Visual effects, spectacular
          locations, set designs, music score...this movie maxes and crashes
          through every metric. The story is vast. VAST. 2.5 hours are needed to
          establish the perimeter of Dune, rough outline of the characters, the
          hierarchy, the game itself. You're left wanting for more. And wait we
          will. 10/10 from me
